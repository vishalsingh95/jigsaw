        <p>My career with Jigsaw Abacus started in 2019 when I got curious about Abacus and Vedic maths methods. I was really surprised to see speed of calculation of students who were learning Abacus with Jigsaw Abacus Centre and I immediately decided to learn and adopt this as my career. Earlier I was taking regular maths tuitions only. But the techniques we use in Abacus and Vedic maths are mind blowing. My students who used to hate maths, enjoy all my classes a lot and they want to come everyday instead of twice a week. </p>

      <p>Hello. I am nitu, it's my pleasure that i got the opportunity to be a part of jigsaw. I joined Jigsaw in 2015 and it has been a really great experience. I really enjoy teaching as students also learn with curiosity and the best part is students can do the calculations in fractions of time. I must say every child should be a part of jigsaw and enhance themselves. <br>Thank you</p>

          <p>Hi I am Shweta Sharma Bhushan, I represent Jigsaw Abacus Wizkid in Gurgaon since last 5 years. I had my tuition centre and I also wanted to start something more innovative and challenging so I started exploring the things. I explored many new prevailing maths teaching methods like cue maths, vedic maths and Abacus.  I found Abacus more innovative and appropriate to start with. So in 2018, I met Vanshika Mam, CEO of Jigsaw abacus and interaction with her made me more confirmed that I want to start my Own Abacus Academy. So now since then have taught more than 200 students and 60 students are currently associated with me through online and offline mode. Today I am successful as an entrepreneur and satisfied as a teacher, mentor and a mother. This could not be possible without support and Guidance from Vanshika Mam and support from Whole Jigsaw team.</p>

        We are very glad to   tell you that jigsaw abacus  academy is one of the most trusted institute with affordable fees. <br>
        Best among all I suggest  everyone to join  . because the teacher respected (Babita ma'am) is the  best   coach along with all facilities team members are all  are very cooperative   and experience  and helpful. The study materials are also helpful. The teacher give you extra time if you have any doubt or clean ur doubts. They even conduct quarterly basis mock test or written test too  so I think my daughter  is taking more interest to learn abacus and we are  immense pleasure ☺️ to see her performance with progress. <br>
         So, Thankyou 🙏 jigsaw team.

These classes are totally value add for my son & he loves her teacher who is knowledgeable, through in her teaching, knows exactly how to teach students and make concepts clear.
